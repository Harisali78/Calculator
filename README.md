# Calculator
This is my first project of Digital Calculator.I am using Visual Studio Code for projects. You just need to install C,C++ extension in VS CODE.
You can use this Calculator to perform following functions:
D:Division
M:Multiplication
A:Addition
S:Subtraction
Please let me know if you have any issue in running the program.
Thank you.
